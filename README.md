## Description

This repository implements the Josephus Problem, a classic theoretical problem in mathematics and computer science. The problem involves a group of people standing in a circle where every k-th person is eliminated until only one remains. The goal is to determine the position of the last person standing given n people and a step count k.


## Files

- `main.c`: The main C file that contains the entry point of the program.
- `functions.h`: Header file that declares the functions used in the program.
- `header.h`: Header file that contains common definitions and includes other necessary headers.
- `node.h`: Header file that defines the structure for the linked list node.
- `names.txt`: A text file that stores the names used in the Josephus Problem.

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler.
3. Run the executable.

## Usage

The program reads the names from the `names.txt` file and performs the Josephus Problem calculation. The output will be displayed on the console.
